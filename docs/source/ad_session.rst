Help for the class ``ADSession`` in module ``ms_active_directory.core.ad_session`` follows:

Manually creating an ``ADSession``
----------------------------------

While it's recommended that you create ``ADSession`` objects from ``ADDomain`` objects,
you can manually create them given a domain and an LDAP connection to it.

The function to do so is as follows::

    class ADSession(builtins.object)
        ADSession(ldap_connection: ldap3.core.connection.Connection, domain: 'ADDomain', search_paging_size: int = 100, trusted_domain_cache_lifetime_seconds: int = 86400)

        Methods defined here:

        __init__(self, ldap_connection: ldap3.core.connection.Connection, domain: 'ADDomain', search_paging_size: int = 100, trusted_domain_cache_lifetime_seconds: int = 86400)
            Create a session object for a connection to an AD domain.
            Given an LDAP connection, a domain, and optional parameters relating to searches and multi-domain
            functionality, create an ADSession object.

            :param ldap_connection: An ldap3 Connection object representing the connection to LDAP servers within
                                    the domain.
            :param domain: An ADDomain object representing the domain that we're communicating with.
            :param search_paging_size: Optional. The page size for paginated searches. If a search is expected to
                                       be able to have more than this many results, a paginated search will be
                                       performed. This is used as the page size in such searches. Changing this
                                       affects the balance between the number of queries made and the size of
                                       each query response in a large scale environment, and so it can be used
                                       to optimize behavior based on network topology and traffic.
                                       If not specified, defaults to 100.
            :param trusted_domain_cache_lifetime_seconds: Optional. How long to maintain our trusted domain cache in
                                                          seconds. The cache of trusted domain information exists because
                                                          trust relationships change infrequently, but will be used a lot
                                                          in searches and such when automatic traversal of trusts is
                                                          supported. Can be set to 0 to disable the cache.
                                                          If not specified, defaults to 24 hours.


Some attributes of the session can changed later. For example, paging size or domain cache lifetimes can be
adjusted in response to observed response sizes and network conditions.
::

    set_domain_search_base(self, search_base: str)
        Set the search base to use for 'find' queries within the domain made by this session.
        This can be used to confine our search to a sub-container within the domain. This can improve
        the performance of lookups, avoid permissioning issues, and remove issues around duplicate
        records with the same common name.

    set_search_paging_size(self, new_size: int)

    set_trusted_domain_cache_lifetime_seconds(self, new_lifetime_in_seconds: int)

There are functions for finding domain resources, such as DNS servers, CA certificates, policies time, etc.
::

    find_certificate_authorities_for_domain(self, pem_format: bool = True, controls: List[ldap3.protocol.rfc4511.Control] = None) -> Union[List[str], List[bytes]]
        Attempt to discover the CAs within the domain and return info on their certificates.
        If a session was first established using an IP address or blind trust TLS, but we want to bootstrap our
        sessions to establish stronger trust, or write the CA certificates to a local truststore for other
        non-LDAP applications to use (e.g. establishing roots of trust for https or syslog over TLS), then it's
        helpful to grab the certificate authorities in the domain and their signing certificates.
        Not all domains run certificate authorities; some use public CAs or get certs from other PKI being run,
        so this isn't useful for everyone. But a lot of people do run CAs in their AD domains, and this is useful
        for them.

        :param pem_format: If True, return the certificates as strings in PEM format. Otherwise, return the
                           certificates as bytestrings in DER format. Defaults to True.
        :param controls: A list of LDAP controls to use when performing the search. These can be used to specify
                         whether or not certain properties/attributes are critical, which influences whether a search
                         may succeed or fail based on their availability.
        :returns: A list of either PEM-formatted certificate strings or DER-formatted certificate byte strings,
                  representing the CA certificates of the CAs within the domain.

    find_current_time_for_domain(self) -> datetime.datetime
        Get the current time for the domain as a datetime object.
        Just calls the parent domain function and returns that. This is included here for completeness.
        :returns: A datetime object representing the current time in the domain.

    find_dns_servers_for_domain(self, controls: List[ldap3.protocol.rfc4511.Control] = None) -> Dict[str, str]
        Attempt to discover the DNS servers within the domain and return info on them.
        If a session was first established using an IP address or blind trust TLS, but we want to bootstrap our
        sessions to use kerberos or TLS backed by CA certificates, we need proper DNS configured. For private
        domains (e.g. in a datacenter), we may run DNS servers within the domain. This function discovers
        computers with a "DNS/" service principal name, tries to look up IP addresses for them, and then
        returns that information.
        This won't always be useful, as DNS isn't always part of the AD domain, but it can help if we're bootstrapping
        a computer with manufacturer configurations to use the AD domain for everything based on a minimal starting
        configuration.

        :param controls: A list of LDAP controls to use when performing the search. These can be used to specify
                         whether or not certain properties/attributes are critical, which influences whether a search
                         may succeed or fail based on their availability.
        :returns: A dictionary mapping DNS hostnames of DNS servers to IP addresses. The hostnames are provided in case
                  a caller is configuring DNS-over-TLS. If no IP address can be resolved for a hostname, it will map to
                  a None value.
                  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8310

    find_forest_schema_version(self) -> ms_active_directory.environment.constants.ADVersion
        Attempt to determine the version of Windows Server set in the forest's schema.
        :returns: An Enum of type ADVersion indicating the schema version.

    find_functional_level_for_domain(self) -> ms_active_directory.environment.constants.ADFunctionalLevel
        Attempt to discover the functional level of the domain and return it.
        This will indicate if the domain is operating at the level of a 2008, 2012R2, 2016, etc. domain.
        The functional level of a domain influences what functionality exists (e.g. 2003 cannot issue AES keys,
        2012 cannot use many TLS ciphers introduced with TLS1.3) and so it can be useful for determining what
        to do.
        :returns: An Enum of type ADFunctionalLevel indicating the functional level.

    find_netbios_name_for_domain(self, force_refresh: bool = False) -> str
        Find the netbios name for this domain. Renaming a domain is a huge task and is incredibly rare,
        so this information is cached when first read, and it only re-read if specifically requested.

        :param force_refresh: If set to true, the domain will be searched for the information even if
                              it is already cached. Defaults to false.
        :returns: A string indicating the netbios name of the domain.

    find_policies_in_domain(self) -> List[ADGroupPolicy]:
        Find all of the policy objects in this domain. The number of policies is often less than the
        number of things affected by them, so querying all of them once and handling mapping locally is
        more desirable than re-querying policies every time a container that bears policies is queried.

        :returns: A list of ADGroupPolicy objects representing the policies in the domain.

    find_sid_for_domain(self) -> str:
        Returns the SID identifier for the domain as a string. This will be unique even if multiple different
        domains exist with the same DNS name (e.g. a domain was cloned from one data center to another) and
        is a part of the SIDs of domain members.
        This will be cached after one lookup because the domain SID doesn't change.

        :returns: A string representing the domain SID.

    find_supported_sasl_mechanisms_for_domain(self) -> List[str]
        Attempt to discover the SASL mechanisms supported by the domain and return them.
        This just builds upon the functionality that the domain has for this, as you don't need
        to be authenticated as anything other than anonymous to read this information (since it's
        often used to figure out how to authenticate).
        This is included in the session object for completeness.
        :returns: A list of strings indicating the supported SASL mechanisms for the domain.
                  ex: ['GSSAPI', 'GSS-SPNEGO', 'EXTERNAL']

    find_upn_suffixes_for_domain(self) -> List[str]:
        Get the user principal name suffixes for the domain. These are alternate domains that users might have
        in their user principal name, and use for logging on.
        For example, a domain that has a read-only domain controller exposed to the internet might support logon
        using both "company.local" and "company.com" so that people can use their username@company.com emails to
        login.
        Similarly, after a merger/acquisition, this may be used to support a smooth transition if trust relationships
        aren't used - where the domains are merged while still allowing "@company1.local" and "@company2.local"
        emails to be used for login (since many other services may be using AD for auth).

    is_domain_close_in_time_to_localhost(self, allowed_drift_seconds=None) -> bool
        Get whether the domain time is close to the current local time.
        Just calls the parent domain function and returns that. This is included here for completeness.
        :param allowed_drift_seconds: The number of seconds considered "close", defaults to 5 minutes.
                                      5 minutes is the standard allowable drift for kerberos.
        :returns: A boolean indicating whether we're within allowed_drift_seconds seconds of the domain time.



Finding Users, Groups, Computers, and other objects
----------------------------------------------------

There are functions for finding users, groups, and computers by a variety of properties.
These properties range from unique distinguishers, like canonical name, SID, or ``sAMAccountName``, to generic
descriptors that can find multiple records, like common name and searching for any records with a specific
attribute value.

You can also look up attributes about the things you look up by specifying a list of LDAP attributes to query.
::

    find_computer_by_distinguished_name(self, computer_dn: str, attributes_to_lookup: List[str] = None, controls: List[ldap3.protocol.rfc4511.Control] = None) -> Union[ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADComputer, NoneType]
        Find a Computer in AD based on a specified distinguished name and return it along with any
        requested attributes.
        :param computer_dn: The distinguished name of the computer.
        :param attributes_to_lookup: A list of additional LDAP attributes to query for the computer. Regardless of
                                     what's specified, the computer's name and object class attributes will be queried.
        :param controls: A list of LDAP controls to use when performing the search. These can be used to specify
                         whether or not certain properties/attributes are critical, which influences whether a search
                         may succeed or fail based on their availability.
        :returns: an ADComputer object or None if the computer does not exist.

    find_computer_by_name(self, computer_name: str, attributes_to_lookup: List[str] = None, controls: List[ldap3.protocol.rfc4511.Control] = None) -> Union[ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADComputer, NoneType]
        Find a Computer in AD based on a provided name.
        This function takes in a generic name which can be either a distinguished name, a common name, or a
        sAMAccountName, and tries to find a unique computer identified by it and return information on the computer.
        :param computer_name: The name of the computer, which may be a DN, common name, or sAMAccountName.
        :param attributes_to_lookup: A list of additional LDAP attributes to query for the computer. Regardless of
                                     what's specified, the computer's name and object class attributes will be queried.
        :param controls: A list of LDAP controls to use when performing the search. These can be used to specify
                         whether or not certain properties/attributes are critical, which influences whether a search
                         may succeed or fail based on their availability.
        :returns: an ADComputer object or None if the computer does not exist.
        :raises: a DuplicateNameException if more than one entry exists with this name.

    find_computer_by_sam_name(self, computer_name: str, attributes_to_lookup: List[str] = None, controls: List[ldap3.protocol.rfc4511.Control] = None) -> Union[ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADComputer, NoneType]
        Find a Computer in AD based on a specified sAMAccountName name and return it along with any
        requested attributes.
        :param computer_name: The sAMAccountName name of the computer. Because a lot of people get a bit confused on
                              what a computer name, as many systems leave out the trailing $ that's common to many
                              computer sAMAccountNames when showing it, if computer_name does not end in a trailing $
                              and no computer can be found with computer_name, a lookup will be attempted for the
                              computer_name with a trailing $ added.
        :param attributes_to_lookup: A list of additional LDAP attributes to query for the computer. Regardless of
                                     what's specified, the computer's name and object class attributes will be queried.
        :param controls: A list of LDAP controls to use when performing the search. These can be used to specify
                         whether or not certain properties/attributes are critical, which influences whether a search
                         may succeed or fail based on their availability.
        :returns: an ADComputer object or None if the computer does not exist.

    find_computer_by_sid(self, computer_sid: Union[ms_active_directory.environment.security.security_config_constants.WellKnownSID, str, ms_active_directory.environment.security.security_descriptor_utils.ObjectSid], attributes_to_lookup: List[str] = None, controls: List[ldap3.protocol.rfc4511.Control] = None) -> Union[ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADComputer, NoneType]
        Find a Computer in AD given its SID.
        This function takes in a computer's objectSID and then looks up the computer in AD using it. SIDs are unique
        so only a single entry can be found at most.
        The computer SID can be in many formats (well known SID enum, ObjectSID object, canonical SID format,
        or bytes) and so all 4 possible formats are handled.
        :param computer_sid: The computer SID. This may either be a well-known SID enum, an ObjectSID object, a string
                             SID in canonical format (e.g. S-1-1-0), object SID bytes, or the hex representation of
                             such bytes.
        :param attributes_to_lookup: A list of additional LDAP attributes to query for the computer. Regardless of
                                     what's specified, the computer's name and object class attributes will be queried.
        :param controls: A list of LDAP controls to use when performing the search. These can be used to specify
                         whether or not certain properties/attributes are critical, which influences whether a search
                         may succeed or fail based on their availability.
        :returns: an ADComputer object or None if the computer does not exist.

    find_computers_by_attribute(self, attribute_name: str, attribute_value, attributes_to_lookup: List[str] = None, size_limit: int = 0, controls: List[ldap3.protocol.rfc4511.Control] = None) -> List[ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADComputer]
        Find all computers that possess the specified attribute with the specified value, and return a list of
        ADComputer objects.

        :param attribute_name: The LDAP name of the attribute to be used in the search.
        :param attribute_value: The value that returned computers should possess for the attribute.
        :param attributes_to_lookup: A list of additional LDAP attributes to query for the computers. Regardless of
                                     what's specified, the computers' name and object class attributes will be queried.
        :param size_limit: An integer indicating a limit to place the number of results the search will return.
                           If not specified, defaults to 0, meaning unlimited.
        :param controls: A list of LDAP controls to use when performing the search. These can be used to specify
                         whether or not certain properties/attributes are critical, which influences whether a search
                         may succeed or fail based on their availability.
        :returns: a list of ADComputer objects representing computers with the specified value for the specified
                  attribute.

    find_computers_by_common_name(self, computer_name: str, attributes_to_lookup: List[str] = None, controls: List[ldap3.protocol.rfc4511.Control] = None) -> List[ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADComputer]
        Find all computers with a given common name and return a list of ADComputer objects.
        This is particularly useful when you have multiple computers with the same name in different OUs
        as a result of a migration, and want to find them so you can combine them.

        :param computer_name: The common name of the computer(s) to be looked up.
        :param attributes_to_lookup: A list of additional LDAP attributes to query for the computers. Regardless of
                                     what's specified, the computers' name and object class attributes will be queried.
        :param controls: A list of LDAP controls to use when performing the search. These can be used to specify
                         whether or not certain properties/attributes are critical, which influences whether a search
                         may succeed or fail based on their availability.
        :returns: a list of ADComputer objects representing computers with the specified common name.


    find_group_by_distinguished_name(self, group_dn: str, attributes_to_lookup: List[str] = None, controls: List[ldap3.protocol.rfc4511.Control] = None) -> Union[ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADGroup, NoneType]
        Find a group in AD based on a specified distinguished name and return it along with any
        requested attributes.
        :param group_dn: The distinguished name of the group.
        :param attributes_to_lookup: A list of additional LDAP attributes to query for the group. Regardless of
                                     what's specified, the group's name and object class attributes will be queried.
        :param controls: A list of LDAP controls to use when performing the search. These can be used to specify
                         whether or not certain properties/attributes are critical, which influences whether a search
                         may succeed or fail based on their availability.
        :returns: an ADGroup object or None if the group does not exist.

    find_group_by_name(self, group_name: str, attributes_to_lookup: List[str] = None, controls: List[ldap3.protocol.rfc4511.Control] = None) -> Union[ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADGroup, NoneType]
        Find a Group in AD based on a provided name.
        This function takes in a generic name which can be either a distinguished name, a common name, or a
        sAMAccountName, and tries to find a unique group identified by it and return information on the group.
        :param group_name: The name of the group, which may be a DN, common name, or sAMAccountName.
        :param attributes_to_lookup: A list of additional LDAP attributes to query for the group. Regardless of
                                     what's specified, the group's name and object class attributes will be queried.
        :param controls: A list of LDAP controls to use when performing the search. These can be used to specify
                         whether or not certain properties/attributes are critical, which influences whether a search
                         may succeed or fail based on their availability.
        :returns: an ADGroup object or None if the group does not exist.
        :raises: a DuplicateNameException if more than one entry exists with this name.

    find_computer_by_principal_name(self, computer_name: str, attributes_to_lookup: List[str] = None,
                                        controls: List[Control] = None) -> Optional[ADComputer]:
        Find a Computer in AD based on a specified userPrincipalName and return it along with any
        requested attributes.
        :param computer_name: The userPrincipalName name of the computer.
        :param attributes_to_lookup: A list of additional LDAP attributes to query for the computer. Regardless of
                                     what's specified, the computer's name and object class attributes will be queried.
        :param controls: A list of LDAP controls to use when performing the search. These can be used to specify
                         whether or not certain properties/attributes are critical, which influences whether a search
                         may succeed or fail based on their availability.
        :returns: an ADComputer object or None if the computer does not exist.

    find_group_by_sam_name(self, group_name: str, attributes_to_lookup: List[str] = None, controls: List[ldap3.protocol.rfc4511.Control] = None) -> Union[ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADGroup, NoneType]
        Find a Group in AD based on a specified sAMAccountName name and return it along with any

        Find a Group in AD given its SID.
        This function takes in a group's objectSID and then looks up the group in AD using it. SIDs are unique
        so only a single entry can be found at most.

Finding and Managing Group Members and Memberships
---------------------------------------------------

There exist functions for finding the groups for a group, user, or computer, as well as finding the members of a group.
There's also functions for managing those memberships, by adding or removing members idempotently.

When looking up members or groups, you can also look up attributes of those groups or members at the same time.
The library does its best to optimize these lookups.

Finding memberships and members::

    find_groups_for_computer(self, computer: Union[str, ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADComputer], attributes_to_lookup: List[str] = None, controls: List[ldap3.protocol.rfc4511.Control] = None, skip_validation: bool = False) -> List[ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADGroup]
        Find the groups that a computer belongs to, look up attributes of theirs, and return information about them.

        :param computer: The computer to lookup group memberships for. This can either be an ADComputer or a string
                        name of an AD computer. If it is a string, the computer will be looked up first to get unique
                        distinguished name information about it unless it is a distinguished name.
        :param attributes_to_lookup: A list of string LDAP attributes to look up in addition to our basic attributes.
        :param controls: A list of LDAP controls to use when performing the search. These can be used to specify
                         whether or not certain properties/attributes are critical, which influences whether a search
                         may succeed or fail based on their availability.
        :param skip_validation: If true, assume all distinguished names exist and do not look them up.
                                Defaults to False. This can be used to make this function more performant when
                                the caller knows all the distinguished names being specified are valid, as it
                                performs far fewer queries.
        :returns: A list of ADGroup objects representing the groups that this user belongs to.
        :raises: a DuplicateNameException if a computer name is specified and more than one entry exists with the name.
        :raises: a InvalidLdapParameterException if the computer name is not a string or ADComputer.

        Find the groups that a list of computers belong to, look up attributes of theirs, and return information
        about them.

        :param computers: The computers to lookup group memberships for. This can be a list of either ADComputer objects
                          or string names of AD computers. If they are strings, the computers will be looked up first
                          to get unique distinguished name information about them unless they are distinguished names.

        Find the parent groups for all of the entities in a List.
        These entities may be users, groups, or anything really because Active Directory uses the "groupOfNames" style
        membership tracking, so all group members are just represented as distinguished names regardless of type.
        If the elements of entities are strings and are not distinguished names, then lookup_by_name_fn will be used
        to look up the appropriate ADObject for the entity and get its distinguished name.

        The parent groups of all the entities will then be queried, and the attributes specified will be looked up
        (if any). A dictionary mapping the original entities to lists of ADGroup objects will be returned.

        :param group: The group to lookup group memberships for. This can either be an ADGroup or a string name of an
                      AD group. If it is a string, the group will be looked up first to get unique distinguished name

Modifying Records Within the Domain
------------------------------------

There exist a number of functions for modifying records.
For users, groups, and computers there exist functions for modifying their attributes, either by appending
values to them or overwriting them.
There's also functions for modifying the security descriptors of objects in order to change the permissions
other principals have on them.

Appending values to user, computer, and group attributes atomically::

    atomic_append_to_attribute_for_computer(self, computer: Union[str, ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADComputer], attribute: str, value, controls: List[ldap3.protocol.rfc4511.Control] = None, raise_exception_on_failure: bool = True, skip_validation: bool = False) -> bool

        :param computer: Either an ADComputer object or string name referencing the computer to be modified.
        :param attribute: A string specifying the name of the LDAP attribute to be appended to.
        :param value: The value to append to the attribute. Value may either be a primitive, such as a string, bytes,
                      or a number, if a single value will be appended. Value may also be an iterable such as a set or
                      a list if a multi-valued attribute will be appended to, in order to append multiple new values
                      to it at once.
        :param controls: LDAP controls to use during the modification operation.
        :param raise_exception_on_failure: If true, an exception will be raised with additional details if the modify

        Add specified permissions to the security descriptor on a computer for specified SIDs.
        This can be used to grant 1 or more other users/groups/computers/etc. the right to take broad actions or narrow
        privileged actions on the computer, via adding access masks or rights guids respectively. It can also give
        1 or more users/groups/computers/etc. the ability to read or write specific properties on the user by
        specifying read or write property guids to add.

        This can, as an example, take a computer and give a user the right to delete it. Or take a computer
        and give a list of computers the right to read and write the user's owner SID. Or take a computer and let

                                    meaning in a self-relative context, or only have meaning on some object types.

        specifying read or write property guids to add.

        This can, as an example, take a group and give another group the right to delete it. Or take a group
        and give a list of computers the right to read the group's SID. Or take a group and let another user
        add members to it. Etc. Etc.

Creating and Taking Over Objects in the Domain
-----------------------------------------------
There exist functions for creating and taking over objects in the domain.
Currently this is limited to computers::

    create_computer(self, computer_name: str, computer_location: str = None, computer_password: str = None, encryption_types: List[Union[str, ms_active_directory.environment.security.security_config_constants.ADEncryptionType]] = None, hostnames: List[str] = None, services: List[str] = None, supports_legacy_behavior: bool = False, **additional_account_attributes) -> ms_active_directory.core.managed_ad_objects.ManagedADComputer
        Use the session to create a computer in the domain and return a computer object.
        :param computer_name: The common name of the computer to create in the AD domain. This
                              will be used to determine the sAMAccountName, and if no hostnames
                              are specified then this will be used to determine the hostnames for
                              the computer.
        :param computer_location: The distinguished name of the location within the domain where
                                  the computer will be created. It may be a relative distinguished
                                  name (not including the domain component) or a full distinguished
                                  name.  If not specified, defaults to CN=Computers which is
                                  standard for Active Directory.
        :param computer_password: The password to be set for the computer. This is particularly
                                  useful to specify if the computer will be shared across multiple
                                  applications or devices, or if pre-creating a computer for another
                                  application to use. If not specified, a random 120 character
                                  password will be generated.
        :param encryption_types: The encryption types to set as supported on the computer in AD.
                                 These will also be used to generate kerberos keys for the computer.
                                 If not specified, defaults to [aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96].
        :param hostnames: The hostnames to use for configuring the service principal names of the
                          computer. These may be short hostnames or fully qualified domain names.
                          If not specified, defaults to the "computer_name" as a short hostname and
                          "computer_name.domain" as a fully qualified domain name.
        :param services: The services to enable on each hostname, which will be used with hostnames
                         to generate the computer's service principal names. If not specified,
                         defaults to ["HOST"] which is standard for Active Directory.
        :param supports_legacy_behavior: Does the computer being created support legacy behavior such
                                         as NTLM authentication or UNC path addressing from older windows
                                         clients? Defaults to False. Impacts the restrictions on
                                         computer naming.
        :param additional_account_attributes: Additional LDAP attributes to set on the account and their
                                              values. This is used to support power users setting arbitrary
                                              attributes, such as "userCertificate" to set the certificate
                                              for a computer that will use mutual TLS for EXTERNAL SASL auth.
                                              This also allows overriding of some values that are not explicit
                                              keyword arguments in order to avoid over-complication, since most
                                              people won't set them (e.g. userAccountControl).
        :returns: an ManagedADComputer object representing the computer.
        :raises: DomainJoinException if any of our validation of the specified attributes fails or if anything
                 specified conflicts with objects in the domain.
        :raises: ObjectCreationException if we fail to create the computer for a reason unrelated to what we can
                 easily validate in advance (e.g. permission issue)

    take_over_existing_computer(self, computer: Union[ms_active_directory.core.managed_ad_objects.ManagedADComputer, ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADObject, str], computer_password: str = None, old_computer_password: str = None) -> ms_active_directory.core.managed_ad_objects.ManagedADComputer
        Use the session to take over a computer in the domain and return a computer object.
        This resets the computer's password so that nobody else can impersonate it, and reads
        the computer's attributes in order to create a computer object and return it.
        :param computer: This can be an ManagedADComputer or ADObject object representing the computer that should be
                         taken over, or a string identifier for the computer.  If it is a string, it should be
                         the common name or sAMAccountName of the computer to find in the AD domain, or it can be
                         the distinguished name of a computer object.
                         If it appears to be a common name, not ending in $, a sAMAccountName will
                         be derived to search for. If that cannot be found, then a search will be
                         done for this as a common name. If no unique computer can be found with that
                         search, then an exception will be raised.
        :param computer_password: The password to be set for the computer. This is particularly
                                  useful to specify if the computer will be shared across multiple
                                  applications or devices, or if pre-creating a computer for another
                                  application to use. If not specified, a random 120 character
                                  password will be generated.
        :param old_computer_password: The current password for the computer. This is used to reduce the level of
                                      permissions needed for the takeover operation.
        :returns: an ManagedADComputer object representing the computer.
        :raises: DomainJoinException if any of our validation of the specified attributes fails or if anything
                 specified conflicts with objects in the domain.
        :raises: ObjectNotFoundException if a computer cannot be found based on the name specified.


Utility Functions For Account Management
-----------------------------------------

There are a number of functions for basic account management actions.
These include modifying passwords in various ways, disabling/enabling accounts, resetting lockouts, etc.

::

    change_password_for_account(self, account: Union[str, ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADUser, ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADComputer], new_password: str, current_password: str, skip_validation: bool = False) -> bool
        Change a password for a user (includes computers) given the new desired password and old desired password.
        When a password is changed, the old password is provided along with the new one, and this significantly reduces
        the permissions needed in order to perform the operation. By default, any user can perform CHANGE_PASSWORD for
        any other user.
        This also avoids invalidating kerberos keys generated by the old password. Their validity will depend on the
        domain's policy regarding old passwords/keys and their allowable use period after change.

        :param account: The account whose password is being changed. This may either be a string account name, to be
                        looked up, or an ADObject object.
        :param current_password: The current password for the account.
        :param new_password: The new password for the account. Technically, if None is specified, then this behaves
                             as a RESET_PASSWORD operation.
        :param skip_validation: If true, assume all distinguished names exist and do not look them up.
                                Defaults to False. This can be used to make this function more performant when
                                the caller knows all the distinguished names being specified are valid, as it
                                performs far fewer queries.
        :returns: True if the operation succeeds. If the operation fails, either an exception will be raised or False
                  will be returned depending on whether the ldap connection for this session has "raise_exceptions"
                  set to True or not.

    disable_account(self, account: Union[str, ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADUser, ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADComputer]) -> bool
        Disable a user account.
        :param account: The string name of the user/computer account to disable. This may either be a
                        sAMAccountName, a distinguished name, or a unique common name. This can also be an ADObject,
                        and the distinguished name will be extracted from it.
        :returns: True if the operation succeeds. If the operation fails, either an exception will be raised or False
                  will be returned depending on whether the ldap connection for this session has "raise_exceptions"
                  set to True or not.

    enable_account(self, account: Union[str, ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADComputer, ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADUser]) -> bool
        Enable a user account.
        :param account: The string name of the user/computer account to enable. This may either be a
                        sAMAccountName, a distinguished name, or a unique common name. This can also be an ADObject,
                        and the distinguished name will be extracted from it.
        :returns: True if the operation succeeds. If the operation fails, either an exception will be raised or False
                  will be returned depending on whether the ldap connection for this session has "raise_exceptions"
                  set to True or not.

    reset_password_for_account(self, account: Union[str, ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADUser, ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADComputer], new_password: str, skip_validation: bool = False) -> bool
        Resets a password for a user (includes computers) to a new desired password.
        To reset a password, a new password is provided to replace the current one without providing the current
        password. This is a privileged operation and maps to the RESET_PASSWORD permission in AD.

        :param account: The account whose password is being changed. This may either be a string account name, to be
                        looked up, or an ADObject object.
        :param new_password: The new password for the account.
        :param skip_validation: If true, assume all distinguished names exist and do not look them up.
                                Defaults to False. This can be used to make this function more performant when
                                the caller knows all the distinguished names being specified are valid, as it
                                performs far fewer queries.
        :returns: True if the operation succeeds. If the operation fails, either an exception will be raised or False
                  will be returned depending on whether the ldap connection for this session has "raise_exceptions"
                  set to True or not.

    unlock_account(self, account: Union[str, ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADComputer, ms_active_directory.core.ad_objects.ADUser], skip_validation: bool = False) -> bool
        Unlock a user who's been locked out for some period of time.
        :param account: The string name of the user/computer account that has been locked out. This may either be a
                        sAMAccountName, a distinguished name, or a unique common name. This can also be an ADObject,
                        and the distinguished name will be extracted from it.
        :param skip_validation: If true, assume all distinguished names exist and do not look them up.
                                Defaults to False. This can be used to make this function more performant when
                                the caller knows all the distinguished names being specified are valid, as it
                                performs far fewer queries.
        :returns: True if the operation succeeds. If the operation fails, either an exception will be raised or False
                  will be returned depending on whether the ldap connection for this session has "raise_exceptions"
                  set to True or not.


Working With Trusted Domains
----------------------------

There exist functions for finding trusted domains as well as transferring authentication sessions to them::

    create_transfer_sessions_to_all_trusted_domains(self, ignore_and_remove_failed_transfers=False) -> List[ForwardRef('ADSession')]
        Create transfer sessions to all of the different active directory domains that trust the domain used for
        this session.

        :param ignore_and_remove_failed_transfers: If true, failures to transfer the session to a trusted domain will
                                                   be ignored, and will be excluded from results. If false, errors will
                                                   be raised by failed transfers. Defaults to false.
        :returns: A list of ADSession objects representing the transferred authentication to the trusted domains.
        :raises: Other LDAP exceptions if the attempt to bind the transfer session in the trusted domain fails due to
                 authentication issues (e.g. trying to use a non-transitive trust when transferring a user that is
                 not from the primary domain, transferring across a one-way trust when skipping validation,
                 transferring to a domain using SID filtering to restrict cross-domain users)

    find_trusted_domains_for_domain(self, force_cache_refresh=False) -> List[ForwardRef('ADTrustedDomain')]
        Find the trusted domains for this domain.
        If we have cached trusted domains for this session's domain, and the cache is still valid based on our
        cache lifetime, return that.

        :param force_cache_refresh: If true, don't use our cached trusted domains even if the cache is valid.
                                    Defaults to false.
        :returns: A list of ADTrustedDomain objects



Other Utility Functions
------------------------

There are other miscellaneous functions for various utility actions, like checking the name of the user/computer
the current session has been established for, checking if distinguished names exist, checking the URI of the
current server a session is communicating with, etc.
::

        dn_exists_in_domain(self, distinguished_name: str) -> bool
            Check if a distinguished name exists within the domain, regardless of what it is.
            :param distinguished_name: Either a relative distinguished name or full distinguished name
                                       to search for within the domain.
            :returns: True if the distinguished name exists within the domain.

        get_current_server_uri(self) -> str
            Returns the URI of the server that this session is currently communicating with

        get_domain(self) -> 'ADDomain'
            Returns the domain that this session is connected to

        get_domain_dns_name(self) -> str
            Returns the domain that this session is connected to

        get_domain_search_base(self) -> str
            Returns the LDAP search base used for all 'find' functions as the search base

        get_ldap_connection(self) -> ldap3.core.connection.Connection
            Returns the LDAP connection that this session uses for communication.
            This is particularly useful if a user wants to make complex LDAP queries or perform
            operations that are not supported by the ADSession object, and is willing to craft
            them and parse results themselves.

        get_search_paging_size(self) -> int

        get_trusted_domain_cache_lifetime_seconds(self) -> int

        is_authenticated(self) -> bool
            Returns if the session is currently authenticated

        is_encrypted(self) -> bool
            Returns if the session's connection is encrypted

        is_open(self) -> bool
            Returns if the session's connection is currently open

        is_session_user_from_domain(self) -> bool
            Return a boolean indicating whether or not the session's user is a member of the domain that we're
            communicating with, or is trusted from another domain.
            :returns: True if the user is from the domain we're communicating with, False otherwise.

        is_thread_safe(self) -> bool
            Returns if the session's connection is thread-safe

        object_exists_in_domain_with_attribute(self, attr: str, unescaped_value: str) -> bool
            Check if any objects exist in the domain with a given attribute. Returns True if so, False otherwise.
            :param attr: The LDAP attribute to examine in the search.
            :param unescaped_value: The value of the attribute that we're looking for, in its raw form.
            :returns: True if any objects exist in the domain with the attribute specified equal to the value.

        who_am_i(self) -> str
            Return the authorization identity of the session's user as recognized by the server.
            This can be helpful when a script is provided with an identity in one form that is used to start a session
            (e.g. a distinguished name, or a pre-populated kerberos cache) and then it wants to determine its identity
            that the server actually sees.
            This just calls the LDAP connection function, as it's suitable for AD as well.
            :returns: A string indicating the authorization identity of the session's user as recognized by the server.
